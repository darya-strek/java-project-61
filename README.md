## The project is a collection of elementary mathematical games: 
##             - Even - finding whether a number is even, 
##             - Calc - simple mathematical calculations, 
##             - GCD - finding the greatest common divisor of numbers, 
##             - Progression - finding the missing member of an arithmetic progression, 
##             - Prime - finding whether a number is prime.
## These games are implemented using basic constructs and methods of Java.
